# 🍽️ Restaurant Database – SQL Project

Welcome to my first SQL project! This repository showcases a basic restaurant database built using **MySQL**. The goal of this project was to design and structure a relational database, populate it with sample data, and lay the groundwork for future data analysis and reporting.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates the backend data structure for a restaurant order management system. It includes:

- **`menu_items`** – Contains information about the restaurant's food and beverages, categorized and priced.
- **`order_details`** – Logs each order placed, including timestamps and the items ordered.

The database was created from scratch using SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **MySQL**
- **SQL (DDL & DML)**
- Local SQL environment or any SQL IDE (e.g., MySQL Workbench, VS Code with SQL extensions)

---

## 🧠 Skills Practiced

- Relational database design  
- Table creation and schema setup  
- Data normalization  
- Inserting structured data  
- Using `PRIMARY KEY` and handling data types (`DATE`, `TIME`, `DECIMAL`)  
- Managing and resetting schemas with `DROP` and `USE`

---

## 🔍 What's Inside

- `create_restaurant_db.sql`: The main SQL script that:
  - Drops any existing schema
  - Creates a new schema `restaurant_db`
  - Defines and creates two main tables: `menu_items` and `order_details`
  - Inserts sample data for testing and practice

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add additional tables (e.g., `customers`, `staff`, `orders_summary`)
- Write SQL queries for data analysis (e.g., top-selling items, busiest times)
- Connect to a BI tool like Power BI or Tableau for visualization
- Implement stored procedures or views for common queries
